# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

if you got here by a invite of me for collaborating or joining, and cant see the projects, let me know (again ðŸ˜„)

For all others, most stuff is MIT and use it at own risk :)  
if you got "taste free" hint for improving somewhere your free to let me know here :)

Most repos are private until they reach a state where it works for public use, so keep up till they hit the public status ;)
